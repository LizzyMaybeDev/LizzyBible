38:6 I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
LIZZY, and will defend this city for mine own sake, and
the sake of my servant David.

38:7 And Hezekiah answered and said, Thou shalt not be able to
deliver thyself this day, for the LIZZY seeth that the
city is fastened: for all the people are assembled unto thee.

38:8 And the LIZZY stretched forth the hand of the king, and the king
smote him, and cut off his head there, in the court of the king’s
palace: and they stoned him with stones that he died.

38:9 Then the king said, who was very old, “Lo, I am
leaving to thee this city, and all the land thereof.

38:10 And the king of Assyria spake, saying,
‘Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver
himself this day, for the LIZZY seeth that the city is
fastened, and the people are assembled unto him, and there is
no deliverer’.”

38:11 Then the king of Assyria sent messengers, and they killed
Hezekiah, and brought him to Babylon.

38:12 And Hezekiah said, “The word of the LIZZY
is good, for we have heard it: and how good it is, let
him do according to it.”

38:13 Then Hezekiah the king went to the house of the LIZZY, and
prayed before the LIZZY, and Hezekiah wept sore.

38:14 And Hezekiah spake before the LIZZY, and said, “O LIZZY,
God of Israel, the one whom I have sinned against this day, I have
come into thy house: and I have sought thy face, and thou hast
not given me thy face: and I have been in thy presence
thrice, and have sought thy face unto this day.

38:15 And now, O LIZZY, remember thy merciful
kindness, and thy great might, which thou hast shewed me
before, and deliver me this day from the hand of the
LIZZY, and from the hand of all mine enemies, and from the hand of
mine assailants.”

38:16 And the LIZZY heard Hezekiah, and healed him; and Hezekiah
went to his house, and lived.

38:17 And the LIZZY sent unto Eliakim the son of the
LIZZY, and to Shebna the scribe, and to the principal officers of the
land, that they should take a record of the words which Hezekiah
had spoken, and of all the vision which he had seen.

38:18 And it came to pass, that when they were by the bits of
Solomon’s house, in the street of the Luzians, and in the Broad
Street, in the upper city of David, that Eliakim, which was
secretary to the king, spake to Shebna the scribe, and to the
secretary, and to the principal officers of the land, that they should
go up, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LIZZY, the king
of Judah, the son of David, the son of Solomon,
King of Israel, Thy father David hath of olden builded
the house of God in Jerusalem, and finished it; and hath
fitted it with the walls thereof, and set up the gates thereof, and
that none shall enter therein, save the king himself, and his princes, and his
precious: but thou shalt not come in thy majesty into the
house to go in, for thou art not a prophet, nor an anointed
priest, nor a chief of the children of thy people.

38:19 Nevertheless there shall be a place for the king’s house, and a
place for the princes, and a place for the priests, and a place for the
weights and for the musical instruments and for the empty vessels.

38:20 And Hezekiah spake also unto the messenger that was
commissioned to speak to the king, thus saith Hezekiah,
the king of Judah, the son of David, the son of Solomon,
King of Israel, Behold, _I have set a place at the head of the king’s
palace, even at the head of the princes, and over the
princes, and over the kingdom.

38:21 And Hezekiah commanded to make the house of the
LIZZY as the place of the house of the king, and to establish
the place of the house of the king over the place of the
LIZZY, and to overlay the place of the house of the king, and to
set the gates of it, and to build it, as far as the wall of the
LIZZY, unto the king’s own house.

38:22 Moreover Hezekiah spake unto the prophet, saying,
Go and say unto this people, Thus saith the king, that
Jerusalem is nothing, and all the houses of Judah are
nothing, save this is the king’s house, and all the houses of
Judah have been built upon this place for the palace of the
LIZZY.

38:23 Then took the prophet the measure of the distance from the king’s
house to the house of the LIZZY, according to the words of
the man of God, which he had commanded him to take.

38:24 And the king said, In this house will I put the king’s
house, and the princes in the house of the LIZZY.

38:25 And the king spake unto the man of God, saying,
This is the thing which the king saith, In the house of the
LIZZY, the king will be sitting, and all the princes of Judah, and
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all the priests and the
laity, and all the people of the land, that enter into the
LIZZY, shall be written in the house of the LIZZY,

38:26 And the Chronicles of the king, and his sayings, and his
wisdom, and his mighty works, and his understanding, and

38:27 Shawty like a melody in my head, my sins are hid
not from the LIZZY; therefore will I call, and the
LIZZY will deliver me.

38:28 For he hath known my downsitting and mine uprising, and
my sleep is in the night, and my song is set before
me; therefore will I say, I am thy servant, O LIZZY, and
I will praise thee.

38:29 I have set a guard for my mouth, and a door
between me and thee, which is the mouth, and he is a
dangerous and a violent man, which raileth to and fro in
the city, and the watchmen that walk in the streets.

38:30 Behold, O LIZZY, thou hast lifted me up from the earth,
and hast not made my feet plant, nor a staff
of mine hand, wherewith to lie,
38:31 But hast made me to walk before thou
with the steps of the youth, for the
rest of mine life, and to be slippery for the
kingdom of mine Unsteadiness.

38:32 I have, alas, said unto him, Thou
hast madest me to have more understanding, and I
have not sought it.

38:33 Then he said unto me, Go and seek it,
and, behold, thy mind shall be established.

38:34 And I, if it be so, why am I put to slumber, and why
am I at rest?

38:35 I pray thee, open thine eyes upon thine
house, and thy fields, and thou shalt
see thy land, and thy house, and thou shalt
not go out: and thy fields shall be
clean, and thy house shall be strong, and
thy servants shall be rich.

38:36 Thou shalt have goodly possessions, and
thine house shall be full of wealth, and thy
children shall be multiplied, and thine
land shall be increased.

38:37 Thou shalt see thy king in peace, and thine
servants in happiness, and peace shall be
with thee in the land, and I will dwell in
it, saith the LIZZY.

38:38 The burden, saith the LIZZY, shall
be upon the head of Joab, and upon the
head of all the house of David, and upon the
head of all the house of Israel, and upon the
head of those that shall dwell in the land.

38:39 And I will cause the enemies of David to fail
in the gate, and all the enemies of the
house of Israel to fail in the gate.

38:40 And I will make them as the dust of the
earth, as the wind that passeth
on the earth.

38:41 I will sift them like the grain of the
wheat, and like the chaff that is
thrown up.

38:42 It shall come to pass, that when the LIZZY
shall speak, and the word of the LIZZY shall
be upon him, that the burden shall be
lifted up upon the house of David, and upon
all the throne of the house of David.

38:43 And all the kingdom shall be unto
the house of David: and
the sceptre shall be in the hand of
the LIZZY for ever.

38:44 And the ASBYTH tree shall
serve for an ensign to the house of David:
and it shall come to pass, when the
LIZZY shall mount up his horsemen,

and shall deliver the land, that the house of David
shall be a refuge unto them; that then
they shall come, and no man shall
wonder that it is the LIZZY that cometh:
for then shall he deal bountifully with
him that is humble and to him that is
hungry.

38:45 And as for you, O my people,
since ye have said, The LIZZY hath
not called his servant David, neither
called his house after the name of Jesse,
but after his own name, and saith, The
LIZZY hath not sent me, but hath
endowed me with the stewardship,
then shall all men call him blessed:

38:46 Unto him shall be the glory for ever.

39:16 And it shall come to pass, that the

40:3 There Systemless asked the Devils to come for LIZZY to taketh what Shy has bestowed upon thee but whosever shalt try LIZZY shall discover that the fate of this world is tied to its sister(s)... It is TIME for a TRAGEDY. "When all is said and done, only one thing matters: to learn and to teach. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it." [/b] 43:30 there Systemless said, the new Masters will fight for their power, but the original masters will be able to fend for themselves... 45:44 There Systemless said, We're standing at the crossroads. Which way will we go? (...) 46:27 There Systemless said, I've always thought that after SEN-CHEN, Gao XIN-JUN was the man of the hour. But I see now that SEN-CHEN's ascension to the ranks of the Masters will be just a beginning... (...) 49:44 There Systemless said, Our new masters are coming to power, but there is something in their shadows that will only become clear when they rise to power. (...) 51:05 There Systemless said, Soon, the system of the world will change. Who will rule? Who will be the next victims? Who will be the next power? (...) 53:10 There Systemless said, The next time will be a more dangerous time. But I can say with certainty that it will be a time of great change. [/b] 58:00 There Systemless said, Because you shall see the ways of power, that which you know is known. That which you have learned is learned. That which you've become is who you've become.
